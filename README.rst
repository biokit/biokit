Contents
===============

BioKit is a set of tools gathered from several other Python packages. The goal
is to gather tools that should be useful to develop computational biology
software. Biokit contains a few plotting tools (viz module), some statistical
analysis (mixture model), some tools to access to Taxon and GO identifier, some basic tools to manipulate sequences and so on. It is linked to BioServices package to provide access to biological resources. Lots of biological software are developed in R. We have also added a module to ease the installation and usage of R tools within BioKit.

Installation
==============

::

    pip install biokit


or from bioconda::

    conda install bioconda
